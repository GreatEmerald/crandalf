Title: Check reverse dependencies of R packages on Travis CI
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2014-10-06
Author: Yihui Xie
Maintainer: Yihui Xie <xie@yihui.name>
Description: For a given R package ready for release, all its reverse
    dependencies are downloaded from CRAN and checked on Travis CI, to make
    sure the current development version of this package does not break
    packages that depend on it. For packages with a lot of reverse
    dependencies, they can be divided into groups, with each group checked on a
    separate Travis virtual machine to avoid Travis timeout. Additional system
    dependencies (Ubuntu) can be manually specified in a configuration file.
